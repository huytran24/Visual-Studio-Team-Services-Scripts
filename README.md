# Visual Studio Team Services scripts
This repository contains misc Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) powershell scripts and custom tasks. When moving from on-premise builds to cloud hosted builds, there were some features that was missing compared to XAML builds.
Hopefully these scripts can be used to fill that gap until Microsoft officially bakes-in those features
